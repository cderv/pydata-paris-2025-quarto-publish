# Let's discuss publishing

when you have notebook analysis and you are ready to share.

## From Notebook...

## From Notebook...

Can this be shared easily only ? 

## ... to Publish‑Ready Report

Let's use Quarto for this

```bash
quarto publish quartopub whr-data-analysis.ipynb
```

## Demo

## Why does this matters ? 

- Faster sharing
- stakeholder-ready output
- reproducibility 
- production-quality

::: {.notes}
Instead of handing over a raw .ipynb, Quarto lets you ship production‑quality HTML and paginated PDFs — polished, brandable, and ready for stakeholders — all from the same source document.
:::

## What is Quarto ? 

- Multi-engine (Jupyter, Knitr), multi-format (HTML, PDF, slides)
- Config-driven via YAML and CLI (quarto render / quarto publish)
- Designed for reproducible, professional output

## How does it work ? 

- ipynb -> quarto render -> html/pdf/typst

Best results by re-executing the notebook using `--execute`

## Where can we publish ? 

````bash
❯ quarto publish --help 

Usage:   quarto publish [provider] [path]
Version: 1.8.24

Description:

  Publish a document or project to a provider.

  Available providers include:

   - Quarto Pub (quarto-pub)
   - GitHub Pages (gh-pages)
   - Posit Connect (connect)
   - Netlify (netlify)
   - Confluence (confluence)
   - Hugging Face Spaces (huggingface)

  Accounts are configured interactively during publishing.
  Manage/remove accounts with: quarto publish accounts  
````

## Why multi-format matters 


## Configuring the rendering

```{.yaml}
---
title: "World Happiness Report"
subtitle: "Happiness Trends and Contributing Factors (2011-2024)"
author: "C. Dervieux"
date: "2025-09-30"
format: 
  html: default
  typst: default
---
```

## Publishing multiple formats

````bash
quarto publish quartopub whr-data-analysis.ipynb
````

## About PDF with Typst

![](images/typst-logo.png)

![](images/typst-workflow.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

::: notes
Typst is a new open-source markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use. Typst is built to simplify the process of creating beautiful, professional PDFs. It uses a markup-based system, which means you write plain text and code to define your document's structure and style, just like you would with Quarto or Markdown.

## Improving the rendering

### No output

```{.yaml}
execute:
  echo: false
```

### Adding table of content

````{.yaml}
toc: true
````

## Adding publications-ready features 

### Caption and Numbering

```{.yaml}
#| label: fig-global-trends
#| fig-cap: "Global average happiness over time (2011-2024)"
```

```{.yaml}
#| label: tbl-top10
#| tbl-cap: "Top 10 happiest countries in 2024"
```

### Cross-referencing

```{.markdown}
From @fig-global-trends, we observe the following trends in global happiness scores over the years:
```
This will resolve to correct figure with numbering and reference link.

### Inline computations results

Special Quarto syntax allowing to interleave computed value and text

````{.markdown}
Finland (`{python} f"{top_countries_2024['ladder_score'][0]:.2f}"`)
````

Requires an execution pass through `quarto render` with `--execute` flag

## What about theming ?

## One theme for publication ready output

## `_brand.yml` for unified theming

## Example for WHR report analyst

```{.yaml}
meta:
  name: World Happiness Report
  link:
    home: https://www.worldhappiness.report/

logo: 
  medium: whr_logo.png

color:
  palette:
    dark-purple: "#93358c"
    light-purple: "#f8f6fb"
    teal: "#04afaf"
    dark-blue: "#086992"
    hot-pink: "#eb068c"
    light-blue: "#1aade4"

  background: white
  foreground: black
  primary: dark-purple
  secondary: hot-pink
  tertiary: light-purple
  dark: black

typography:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      source: google
      weight: [400, 700]

  base:
    family: Montserrat
    weight: 400

  headings:
    family: Montserrat
    weight: 700
    color: dark-purple

  link:
    color: primary
    decoration: none
```
